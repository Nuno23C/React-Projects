This repository contains a collection of React projects that I built while following a [React course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). 

These projects cover a variety of React concepts, including:
- Setting up a React project
- Using React components
- Handling state and props
- Creating reusable components
- Working with events
- Building dynamic interfaces
- Deploying React applications
